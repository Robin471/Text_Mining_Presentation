Subject: Internet Service Complaint

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the internet service provided by your company. The consistently poor quality and unreliable connection have become intolerable.

I have experienced frequent outages, slow data speeds, and an overall lack of reliability that has greatly inconvenienced me. Despite multiple attempts to resolve these issues through your customer service, I have yet to see any improvement.

This level of service is unacceptable, and I demand a prompt resolution to these ongoing problems. If this matter is not addressed to my satisfaction, I will have no choice but to seek alternative internet service providers.

I expect immediate attention to this matter and a resolution within a reasonable timeframe. Failure to do so will result in the loss of a long-standing customer.

Sincerely,

Matthew
